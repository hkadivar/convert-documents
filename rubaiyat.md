#RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM

##*By Omar Khayyam*

###Rendered into English Verse by Edward Fitzgerald


#First Edition


##I.

###Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night
###Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
####And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught
###The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.


##II.

###Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky
###I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,
####"Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup
###Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."


##III.

###And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before
###The Tavern shouted--"Open then the Door.
####You know how little while we have to stay,
###And, once departed, may return no more."


##IV.

###Now the New Year reviving old Desires,
###The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,
####Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough
###Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.


##V.

###Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,
###And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;
####But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields,
###And still a Garden by the Water blows.


##VI.

###And David's Lips are lock't; but in divine
###High piping Pelevi, with "Wine!  Wine!  Wine!
####Red Wine!"--the Nightingale cries to the Rose
###That yellow Cheek of hers to'incarnadine.


##VII.

###Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring
###The Winter Garment of Repentance fling:
####The Bird of Time has but a little way
###To fly--and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.


##VIII.

###And look--a thousand Blossoms with the Day
###Woke--and a thousand scatter'd into Clay:
####And this first Summer Month that brings the Rose
###Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away.


##IX.

###But come with old Khayyam, and leave the Lot
###Of Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot:
####Let Rustum lay about him as he will,
###Or Hatim Tai cry Supper--heed them not.


##X.

###With me along some Strip of Herbage strown
###That just divides the desert from the sown,
####Where name of Slave and Sultan scarce is known,
###And pity Sultan Mahmud on his Throne.
