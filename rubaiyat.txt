*By Omar Khayyam*

### Rendered into English Verse by Edward Fitzgerald

First Edition
=============

I.
--

### Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night

### Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:

### And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught

### The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.

II.
---

### Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky

### I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,

### "Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup

### Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."
